# Benchmark Sources

These are the two components needed to run the benchmark. They can be obtained by one of the 
following methods

1. Check it out with the benchmark harness 
   ```sh
   git clone $BENCHMARK_REPO_ADDRESS --recursive
   ```
2. Fetch it after the benchmark
   ```sh
   git clone $BENCHMARK_REPO_ADDRESS
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
